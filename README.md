MERN todolist - (M)JSON DB (E)xpress (R)eact (N)ode  
I got annoyed of how overcluttered the other ones are

API (thank you node):
- `/data`
    - The /data endpoint takes a post request with the name of the list you would like to return 

REACT completed, moving to a better list system

todo:
- handle json properly using hooks
    - make list render (in handleList.jsx)
- make file if doesnt exist (in listJsonData.js)
- add/remove
- draggable (resource)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7pvH1O5Ho]
- implament styled compomponents (site)[https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#existing-css]
- right click menu (add, remove, add cat)

- settings (high -> low priority)
    - list selection 
    - themes
    - font size
    - appearance (how the app looks)
