# todo
Js, css, html, node, todolist. I got annoyed of how overcluttered the other ones are

this shall have react and index.js

todo:
- make file if doesnt exist (in listJsonData.js)
- add/remove
- draggable (resource)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7pvH1O5Ho]


with this I'm refactoring -> node env (index.js)


commands:
- `browserify js/todo.js -o public/bundle.js`
